# More resources

Like I said in the README, all I've tried to do in this document is
capture useful info from my own POV and hope that by making it
particular to my own workflow, I can make it more understandable as a
whole.

But obviously there are lots of other resources out there for working
with git and GitHub, and some that even discuss design projects or
type design.

The most obvious place to start is this "Git for Type Designers"
document written by Frank Grie√ühammer:
[https://github.com/frankrolf/git-for-type-designers](https://github.com/frankrolf/git-for-type-designers). My
one and only caveat about it is that it's fairly brief and it hasn't
been updated in a while.

If you like video resources, I'm aware of these two that are about
type design and are made by people who genuinely know what they're
doing as designers and as git users:

- "A Git-based Workflow for Collaborative Font Making" by Natalia
  Qadreh:
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jky7c2kkEGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jky7c2kkEGY)
  - This video talks about how teams of designers use git, but its
    advice is all good for individual typeface projects, too.
- "Basic Git for Type Designers" by Eli Heuer:
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD6O3Gf7FBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD6O3Gf7FBg)
  - This video is very hands-on and takes the viewer through actually
    typing all the commands to move around and use git in a terminal.
	
There are also a couple of good generalized-howto pages that I think
are helpful without throwing all the possible details (most of which
aren't relevant to you) out at the same time:

- "git - the simple guide" by Roger Dudler:
  [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
  - This is a really short one, but it focuses on just the parts of
    git that you genuinely need.
- "Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous" by Michael Hartl:
  [https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial/getting_started](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial/getting_started)
  - This is written from the perspective of somebody wanting to be a
    programmer, so it leans that way, but the descriptions and
    explanations are good.
- "An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners" by Hubspot:
  [https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
  - This is a corporate blog, and it reads like it, but it's pretty
    practical and explains several of the "why"s well.
	
I think that the official documentation from the git project itself is
probably good to read through next. It does attempt to describe almost
all the features that git provides (at least, the ones that most
people use in programming projects) but it's well-written and just as
importantly, it's really well-organized, so you can find things fairly
easily if you have a particular question: [https://git-scm.com/book](https://git-scm.com/book)

I also think that GitHub's "Education" section is pretty good. Just be
aware that it is highly focused on using git specifically with GitHub,
and it does not always make it so clear where boundary is between the
two: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)

They also have a nice, printable PDF "cheatsheet" covering the main git
commands: [https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
